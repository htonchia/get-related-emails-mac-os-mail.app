# get-related-emails-mac-os-mail.app

Mac OS applescript for mail.app

Features:
- window progress bar
- menu item from the service menu of mail.app
- move related sent emails to the current mailbox

Issue to solve:
Being able to fectch the sent emails related to a conversation and move them in the current mailbox.

For example, if you want to trash a conversation, you trash the conversation in the current mailbox, 
but that won't trash your sent emails from the sent box.
By using this script, after you have trashed your conversation, you go to trash, select an email and fetch all the related
emails from the OUTBOX and move them in the Trash. Et Voil√†.
But you can also do it from an other mailbox, doesn't have to be Trash.
